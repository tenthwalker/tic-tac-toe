# Tic-Tac-Toe 

### Abstract:
This application allows users to play games of Tic-Tac-Toe. They can alternate turns placing tokens in empty squares and auto-reset after either a win or draw to play again. Their wins will be tracked on the respective player's side of the screen.

### Installation Instructions:
1. To get this app running, clone it down from GitHub under the "<> Code" dropdown. 
2. Open it from your terminal or preferred CLI with `git clone <HTTPS or SSH key>`. 
3. Move (`cd`) into the directory. 
4. Open the file in your code editor of choice, and you'll have everything you need! 
5. The app can be viewed and interacted with in your browser of choice by using `open index.html` in your terminal.

### Context:
This project was assigned during Week 5 of Module 1 in Turing's Front-End Engineering track.

### Contributors:
This application was built by [Arden Ranta](https://github.com/tenthwalker/).

### Learning Goals:
The goals of this project were to build a tic-tac-toe game by writing DRY JavaScript, demonstrate our understanding of event delegation, and maintaining a robust data model. We also had to practice solo problem solving and iteration through DOM elements with for loops.

These were enacted on a MacBook Pro using GitHub, VS Code, Google Chrome, and the Mac Terminal.

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins included exploring accessibility colors, seamless event targeting, and realizing how much more quickly CSS styling has come to me with ongoing practice. 
Challenges included finding the motivation to stay focused, and walking back through code with console.logs to isolate and identify points of failure.
