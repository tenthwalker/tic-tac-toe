### Context:
This project was assigned during Week 5 of Module 1 in Turing's Front-End Engineering track.

### Contributors:
This application was built by [Arden Ranta](https://github.com/tenthwalker/).

### Learning Goals:
The goals of this project were to build a tic-tac-toe game by writing DRY JavaScript, demonstrate our understanding of event delegation, and maintaining a robust data model. We also had to practice solo problem solving and iteration through DOM elements with for loops.

These were enacted on a MacBook Pro using GitHub, VS Code, Google Chrome, and the Mac Terminal.
